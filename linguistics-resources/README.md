# Linguistic Resources

This directory contains the following resources:

- **corpus.csv**: the corpus built from collected reviews on Google Places;
- **liwc-filtred.txt**: the lexical informations filtered from LIWC in a more acessible format for algorithms to run;
- **dsl.txt**: the domain specific lexicon built to be compared with LIWC.

The construction methodology for both **corpus** and **dsl** are described in the paper.
